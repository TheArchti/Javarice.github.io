    <h3>NEEDS OF OUR CONTENT</h3>
</div>
<div class="needsMain">
    <p>Our content requires a plethora of both logistical needs and human effort and skill. In terms of what will be needed in
        ideating the content, our organization will ensure to have experts to assist in production, be well informed of the
        community and sitution in Sitio Bebe, and be carefully made to ensure it can be easily understood by as many people
        within our targer audience due to the admittedly younger and less mature majority within it.</p>

</div>
<p class="paragraphlast">Now that we've discussed
     the plans of production, let us offer and present 
     our own solutions that will be further discussed 
     and elaborated on in our educational content. 
     After collecting our funds after the concert, 
     we will first distribute 20% of the funds for 
     air treatment and health treatment. 
     We also plan on providing programs that w
     ill teach the people of Sitio Bebe to reduce emissions from other sources like 
     burning wood or trash and construction dust. We will start a plantain program to 
     help filter the air pollution. 
     In addition, we would give the 
     people of Sitio Bebe lots of N95 face masks 
     for those who are working in a mining space. 
     Then, we will distribute 40% of our funds to 
     the medical health programs since Sitio Bebe 
     lacks health programs. Next, we will be 
     donating medical equipment such as 
     first aid kits, medicine, vaccines, and nebulizers for those who have respiratory problems. Furthermore, we will use 40% of our funds to install a proper clean water system like water tanks so the community will have constant access to clean water. Lastly, if in case our funds are not enough for a decent water system, we will change the distribution of the funds to 60% and 40% air treatment and medical programs.</p>
